      # This is needed, as java doesn't respect the environment variable $HOME, but gets the
      # user home by other means from the system. The default user in the above container is
      # 'root' with the home at '/root', while GitHub runner overrides $HOME to the mounted
      # '/github/home'. As a result, maven uses the ~/.m2 at a different location than assumed
      # by the standard GitHub actions like 'actions/setup-java', causing caching of the maven
      # local repository not working.
      # TODO(2K): This can be better solved by preparing a custom image for the container.
